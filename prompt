I am building an app for counting the number of ice creams people eat. The application should have the following features:
- Add a person.
- Display the contestants in a leaderboard as a table.
- The leaderboard should be sorted by ice cream count, with the highest count on top, highlighted by a larger font.
- Each row in the leaderboard should have three functions: Remove person, decrement ice cream (- button), increment ice cream (+ button)
- The score in the leaderboard should be given by the number of ice creams, represented by a repeating number of ice cream font awesome icons, followed by the score in parenthesis.
- There should be a column in the app that lists all the timestamps of the ice creams for each person
- The app should store and retrieve data in a local json file on the server.
- The app should use bootstrap as the ui framework and have a modern, dark mode design.
- Mobile support
- Add a header, title, and a footer
- There should be a button at the bottom "clear data" that clears all the data in the app.
- The app should run in a node server environment
- The app should use best practice file structure, and split functionality into smaller files as appropriate

Ask clarifying questions as we go, as needed.

First, give me a file tree of all the files needed for the app. 

Then give me the commands needed to initialize the app development and create all folders and touch all files. Also, give me all the needed npm commands.
